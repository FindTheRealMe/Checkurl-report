Import Tip:

First you should open the function of POP3/SMTP of your qq email !!!

The Smtp address you used,is depended on what type email is  used:
For example ,if you use qq:
for enterprise,the addr is:  smtp.exmail.qq.com
for general ,the addr is: smtp.qq.com 
#If you are using gmail,the addr:
general:
smtp.gmail.com

But you should open settings:
https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps
https://accounts.google.com/b/0/displayunlockcaptcha

Gmail's ssl you should set to: 
smtp.starttls()

#
The general guide using scripts:
You should give a argument to the checkurl.sh  shell script.
like this:

sh checkurl.sh members.3322.org/dyndns/getip 3

If the first argument is empty ,the default value is members.3322.org/dyndns/getip,  the second argument is empty,the default value is 3,or if the second argument is not empty, the second argument will be used as the retry count.
so :
[ sh checkurl.sh members.3322.org/dyndns/getip 3 ]   is equal to [ sh checkurl.sh ]
